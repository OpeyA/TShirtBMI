# TShirtBMI
A BMI calculator for a fictional T Shirt company. In my scritping class we were asked to use JQuery validator to implement a BMI calculator for a fictional T-Shirt company. I added some effects to allow a T-sht to pop up in the UI when the user clicks the "Calculate" button. The t-shirt also will have a print out text with the BMI of the user.The SHirt also changes color with a click of a button.
